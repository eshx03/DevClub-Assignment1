                    <h2>What is COVID?</h2><br>
                        <p>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing an ongoing pandemic. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.</p>

                <h2>Myths and FAQs</h2><br><br>
                <div class="Myths">
                    <div class="COVID19"><p><b>Can Covid-19 be transmitted through mosquitoes?</b><br><br>There is no evidence that
                        the novel coronavirus can be
                        transmitted through mosquitoes.
                        The virus can be spread through
                        droplets from coughing, sneezing
                        or a patient’s saliva.</p></div>
                    <div class="Delta"><p><b>How can we be sure
                        that our clothes don’t
                        spread coronavirus?</b><br><br>Besides showering every day, you should wash your clothes using
                        detergent or soap in 60-90 ํC water or add bleach. Dry the clothes
                        in a high temperature dryer or in the sun.</p></div>
                    <div class="Omicron"><p><b>Can drinking alcohol help prevent Covid-19?</b>
                     <br> <br> Drinking alcohol, such as beer, liquor, wine doesn’t help prevent coronavirus.
                     You should wash your hands often, wear masks, and avoid being close to
                     those with a fever and cough.</p></div>
                </div><br><br>
                <div class="FAQs">
                    <div class="COVID19"><p><b>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</b><br> <br>
                        Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
                        transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
                        through the air. </p></div>
                    <div class="Delta"><p><b>Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?</b> <br><br>
                        The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
                        appears to be low </p></div>
                    <div class="Omicron"><p><b>How likely am I to catch COVID-19?</b><br> <br>
                        The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                        there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.</p></div>
